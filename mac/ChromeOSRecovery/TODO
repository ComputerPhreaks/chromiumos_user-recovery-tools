TODO

Would be nice, but not now
- Automatically unpack zip/bz2 archives for locally-selected files
 - Easy workaround: user can do it him/herself
- Use CommonCrypto to SHA-1 on the fly as data arrives
 - Using NSTask after the fact works now; NSURLDownload writes straight to a
   file and it'd be hard to do this
- Pad out the writes to the block size rather than using OPENDEV_BLCK if the
  image is a non-multiple of the block size
- Estimate time remaining for download and burn
